## Module Overview

This write-up documents my hands-on experience completing the SOC Team Internals module on TryHackMe.  
The module focuses on the core responsibilities of a SOC L1 analyst**, including alert triage, classification, investigation, reporting, and escalation in simulated real-world SOC environments.

This module is built around the central concept of any SOC team — security alerts.  
I learned how to triage and classify alerts, document findings, write reports, and follow proper escalation and communication procedures. These skills are essential for operating in real SOC environments and building confidence for TryHackMe SOC-SIM and entry-level SOC roles.

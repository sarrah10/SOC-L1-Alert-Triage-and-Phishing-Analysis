# SOC-L1-Alert-Triage-and-Phishing-Analysis

This repository documents my hands-on learning and investigations completed as part of the TryHackMe SOC Analyst 1 path, specifically focusing on SOC Team Internals and SOC Simulator labs.

The objective of this repository is to demonstrate entry-level SOC analyst skills including alert triage, phishing analysis, log investigation, incident reporting, and escalation decision-making in simulated real-world SOC environments.

# Skills Demonstrated

SOC L1 Alert Triage
True Positive / False Positive Classification
Phishing Email Analysis
Firewall & Network Log Analysis
Incident Documentation using 5Ws
Escalation & Remediation Planning
SOC Metrics Awareness (MTTD, MTTR, False Positives)

# Module Completed – SOC Team Internals

SOC L1 Alert Triage
Learned the lifecycle of SOC alerts and how L1 analysts triage alerts from event generation to resolution.

SOC L1 Alert Reporting
Practiced documenting alerts, escalating incidents, and communicating findings clearly in a SOC environment.

SOC Workbooks and Lookups
Used SOC workbooks, asset inventories, and lookup techniques to enrich alert investigations.

SOC Metrics and Objectives
Learned key SOC performance metrics such as SLA, MTTD, MTTA, MTTR, and the importance of reducing false positives.

Lab – Introduction to Phishing (SOC Simulator)
Completed the SOC Simulator scenario by identifying and closing all True Positive alerts.
